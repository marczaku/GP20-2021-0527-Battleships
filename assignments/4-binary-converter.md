# Binary Converter

Write a Program that reads (`cin`) decimal Integer numbers (positive only)
And Oututs the Binary representation of that number: `0b110`

- Firstly, implement the function the way we know, with division and modulo.
- Secondly, implement the function using binary operations.

Tip: Both exercises will be a lot easier, if you output one character at a time!
