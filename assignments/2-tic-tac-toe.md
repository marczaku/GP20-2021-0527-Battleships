# Tic Tac Toe

- 2 Players
  - Player 1: `X`
  - Player 2: `O`
- 3x3 Grid - we have not learned about Arrays, yet, but for 3x3, it can be done otherwise, too :)
- players take turns choosing an empty grid cell and putting their symbol into it
- player that has three of his symbols either
  - horizontally
  - vertically
  - diagonally
  wins and the game ends instantly.
- make an ASCII-Art Display of the grid 
```
 | |X
-----
O|X|
-----
O| |
```
- implement AI-Player :)
