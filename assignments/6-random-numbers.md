- Create a large number of random numbers between 1 and 20!
- Count how often every number appears
- Compare this to the ideal distribution 
  - (i.e. display probability of every number or something like that)
  - maybe, show the average, absolute discrepancy off the expected value

```
Number 2: 189 times (4.975%)
Number 3: 191 times (5.025%)
...
Maximum Offet: Number 4 (0.004%)
Minimum Offet: Number 7 (0.0%)
Average Offet: 0.002%
```
