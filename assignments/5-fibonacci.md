# Fibonacci Numbers
- Fibonacci(n) is defined as:
  - Fibonacci(0) = 0
  - Fibonacci(1) = 1
  - Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)
- Implement this function using recursion
- Implement this function using iteration
  - Iteration defines an algorithm that is implemented using iterations (loops)
  - Rather than recursive (self-calling) function calls

Optional:
- Try to compare the performance of each implementation
- Can you notice a difference?
- How do you explain that?
